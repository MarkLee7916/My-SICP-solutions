# My-SICP-solutions
My solutions for the programming exercises in the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" written in Haskell. 

I'm currently working through chapter 2. Will update as I go on. I'm also missing a couple of questions in chapter 1, so I'll update when I've covered FileIO in Haskell.

So far I've really enjoyed the book. It can be frustratingly difficult at times, but I feel like I've learned alot in terms of problem solving and thinking about problems in a functional manner. The exercises are difficult, but completing them is definitely worth it as they force you to really think about the content.

I'm still in the process of learning Haskell, so I'll be updating my solutions as I learn more about best practices and how to write clean code. Any tips would be appreciated.
