<h1>Caveats</h1>
<p>Originally I intended to only upload the solutions for the programming exercises, however near the end of chapter 2 I decided to answer all the questions.</p>
<p>I've managed to figure out the answers to the majority of the questions, however some of them I couldn't figure out.</p>
<p>Despite not using lisp I've written a lot of the code to be similar to what a lisp implementation might look like. The Haskell and JavaScript code isn't intended to be idiomatic</p>
